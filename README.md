# Functional Programming Concepts ‚Äî Multi-language Examples

This project provides a **comprehensive, multi-language reference** for 13 fundamental **Functional Programming (FP)** concepts, fully implemented and documented in **Scala**, **Java**, **Python**, and **TypeScript**.

Each file contains **complete code examples** with in-line explanations, covering the theory, practical usage, and relevant laws.

---

## üìö Concepts Included

1. Lambda, Application, Currying, Partial Application
2. Composition (‚àò)
3. Referential Transparency
4. Immutability
5. Higher‚ÄëOrder Functions (HOFs)
6. Functor (map)
7. Applicative (ap / mapN)
8. Monad (flatMap / bind)
9. Natural Transformation
10. Monoid (associative op + identity)
11. Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) & Pattern Matching
12. Effects at the Edges
13. Property‚ÄëBased Testing of Laws

## üìÇ Structure

```
/scala/FPAnnotated.scala       # Scala examples (uses Cats for Applicative/Monoid)
/java/FPJavaAnnotated.java     # Java examples (Optional, records, sealed interfaces)
/python/fp_annotated.py        # Python examples (dataclasses, match, Maybe)
/typescript/fpAnnotated.ts     # TypeScript examples (Option, discriminated unions, Promise)
README.md                      # Project overview and usage
```

## üöÄ Running the Code

### Scala

```bash
sbt console
:load scala/FPAnnotated.scala
```

Requires adding:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "cats-core" % "2.12.0"
```

### Java

```bash
javac java/FPJavaAnnotated.java
java FPJavaAnnotated
```

### Python

```bash
python3 python/fp_annotated.py
```

### TypeScript

```bash
npm install -g typescript ts-node
npx ts-node typescript/fpAnnotated.ts
```

## üß† Goals

* Understand FP concepts across multiple languages.
* Learn to apply theory (functors, applicatives, monads) in real code.
* Recognize shared patterns and idioms across ecosystems.
* Practice reasoning about laws like identity, composition, and associativity.
